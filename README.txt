The game is a space shooting game. I implemented collision checking
among the nuke, rocks, and the fighter. I also implemented 3 advanced
features:
1. powerup
2.scorlling background
3.sound

To pause, press SPACE bar, to resume, press RETURN/ENTER

To fire a nuke, click left button on mouse. Move around the screen with
W, A, S, D.

The game starts with a countdown time and a score of 0. You get 1 score
by shooting down one rock, and each time you shoot down a rock, a new one
appears at a random location (so it is pure luck that you do not get killed)
For each 10 rocks you shoot down, you get a short period of powerup, and
your fighter become fast, with the powerup time left on top left corner.
Each time you can only fire one nuke.

Game is over either your fighter collide with a rock, all rocks are gone
in the scrolling background, or time is up.
